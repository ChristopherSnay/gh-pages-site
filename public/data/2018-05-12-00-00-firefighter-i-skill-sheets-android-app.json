      "content": "Preparing for the Firefighter I Practical Exams meant navigating a dense, ~200-page PDF filled with skill sheets \u2014 not exactly optimized for quick reference or mobile use. To streamline the experience, I built an Android app that transforms those static documents into an interactive study tool.",

      "content": "Using Python, I parsed the PDF into structured Java datasets, extracting each skill sheet's content and metadata. These datasets were then rendered in a clean, navigable GUI built with native Android components. The result: a searchable, scrollable, and far more user-friendly way to study on the go.",

      "content": "This project was a great exercise in cross-language data handling, GUI design, and solving a real-world problem with code. It's not flashy \u2014 but it's practical, and it made a difference when it mattered most.",

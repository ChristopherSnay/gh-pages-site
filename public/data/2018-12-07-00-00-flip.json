This project was a hands-on exploration of Android UI components, from buttons and text views to dynamic layout handling. While the gameplay is simple \u2014 roll dice, flip tiles, and try to shut the box \u2014 the challenge lay in translating tactile mechanics into a smooth digital experience. It was a great exercise in managing state, user input, and visual feedback, all within the constraints of a mobile interface.",
